 Prototype of the gameplay mechanics for the Space RPG

My second project. Not the most beautiful code I've ever seen, but it's still better than TopDownFPS1. Or at least I hope so. Except bugs, shooting mechanics are mostly finished, you can change between various ships and ammo types and even fight enemies with veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeery simple AI (and in order to do it, you have to teleport between maps which also changes controls). This project has potential, but I reached the moment when I should start making the world map, and because I don't really like creating leves and creating HUD, I moved on.
